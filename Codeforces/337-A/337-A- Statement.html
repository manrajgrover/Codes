   <p>The end of the school year is near and Ms. Manana, the teacher, will soon have to say goodbye to a yet another class. She decided to prepare a goodbye present for her <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> students and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle (which, as wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, often oddly shaped, interlocking and tessellating pieces).</p>
   <p>The shop assistant told the teacher that there are <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> puzzles in the shop, but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of <span class="tex-span"><i>f</i><sub class="lower-index">1</sub></span> pieces, the second one consists of <span class="tex-span"><i>f</i><sub class="lower-index">2</sub></span> pieces and so on.</p>
   <p>Ms. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible. Let <span class="tex-span"><i>A</i></span> be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys and <span class="tex-span"><i>B</i></span> be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose such <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> puzzles that <span class="tex-span"><i>A</i>?-?<i>B</i></span> is minimum possible. Help the teacher and find the least possible value of <span class="tex-span"><i>A</i>?-?<i>B</i></span>.</p>

   <p>Sample 1. The class has 4 students. The shop sells 6 puzzles. If Ms. Manana buys the first four puzzles consisting of 10, 12, 10 and 7 pieces correspondingly, then the difference between the sizes of the largest and the smallest puzzle will be equal to 5. It is impossible to obtain a smaller difference. Note that the teacher can also buy puzzles 1, 3, 4 and 5 to obtain the difference 5.</p>
